#09.线程通信

线程通信的目的在于：让线程之间可以彼此发送信号。因此，线程通信也让线程等待其他线程发送的信号。举个例子，线程B等待线程A的信号，这个信号用于通知线程B数据已经准备就绪。

##通过共享对象通信（Signaling via Shared Objects）

线程间进行通信，一个简单的做法就是**通过共享对象存储信号值**。线程A在同步代码块中将`hasDataToProcess`的值设为`true`，然后线程B在同步代码块中读取`hasDataToProcess`的值，这就完成了一次线程通信。下面的这个示例MySignal类用于保存信号值，并提供方法获取这个信号值：

```Java
public class MySignal{
  protected boolean hasDataToProcess = false;

  public synchronized boolean hasDataToProcess(){
    return this.hasDataToProcess;
  }

  public synchronized void setHasDataToProcess(boolean hasData){
    this.hasDataToProcess = hasData;  
  }
}
```

为了进行通信，线程A和线程B必须拥有共享的MySignal的实例对象的引用。如果线程A和线程B拥有的是不同的MySignal实例引用，它们将不会检测到彼此的信号。The data to be processed can be located in a shared buffer separate from the MySignal instance.

##忙等待（Busy Wait）


线程B等待数据可用，然后对数据进行处理。换言之，线程B等待线程A发送的信号量，通过检测`hasDataToProcess() `的返回值，如果返回值为true，则证明此时数据准备就绪。下面的循环用于检测信号：

```Java
protected MySignal sharedSignal = ...

while(!sharedSignal.hasDataToProcess()){
  //do nothing... busy waiting
}
```

注意这个while循环直至`hasDataToProcess() `返回`true`才退出，这种做法称为**忙等待（Busy Waiting）**。线程在等待过程中一直处于忙碌状态。


##wait(), notify()和notifyAll()

忙等待对计算机的CPU利用率并不友好，除非平均等待时间十分短暂。更好的做法是，让等待的线程处于休眠状态或非活动状态直至它收到信号。

Java内置了等待机制可以让线程处于非活动状态直至收到信号。`java.lang.Object`中定义了三个方法：**wait()**,**notify()**和**notifyAll**用来实现这个机制。

在线程内部调用任意对象的`wait()`会使该线程变成暂停状态，直到其他线程调用同一个对象的`notify()`或`notifyAll()`方法。如果想要调用对象的wait()/notify()方法，线程先必须取的该对象的同步锁。换言之，**wait()和notify()方法的调用必须在同步代码内部**。上面例子的wait()/notify()版本：

```Java
public class MonitorObject{
}

public class MyWaitNotify{

  MonitorObject myMonitorObject = new MonitorObject();

  public void doWait(){
    synchronized(myMonitorObject){
      try{
        myMonitorObject.wait();
      } catch(InterruptedException e){...}
    }
  }

  public void doNotify(){
    synchronized(myMonitorObject){
      myMonitorObject.notify();
    }
  }
}
```

等待通知的线程调用`doWait()`方法，而通知线程调用`doNotify()`方法。当一个线程调用一个对象的`notify()`方法后，等待这个对象的其中一个线程就被唤醒并执行。与`notify()`方法不同的是，`notifyAll()`会唤醒所有等待这个对象的线程。

正如你所看到的，`wait()`和`notify()`的调用都在同步块中。这是强制性的要求。如果线程没有拥有对象的锁，则不能调用该对象的`wait()`,`notify()`和`notifyAll()`方法，否则将会抛出`IlleageMonitorStateException` 异常。

But, how is this possible? Wouldn't the waiting thread keep the lock on the monitor object (myMonitorObject) as long as it is executing inside a synchronized block? Will the waiting thread not block the notifying thread from ever entering the synchronized block in doNotify()? The answer is no. Once a thread calls wait() it releases the lock it holds on the monitor object. This allows other threads to call wait() or notify() too, since these methods must be called from inside a synchronized block.

当一个等待的线程被唤醒之后并不会立即离开`wait()`方法直至调用`notify()`方法的线程退出代码块。换言之，因为`wait()`方法嵌套在同步代码块内部，所以被唤醒的线程需要重新获得模拟器对象的锁才能够离开`wait()`方法。如果有多个线程通过`notifyAll()`方法被唤醒，同一时间也只能有一个线程能够离开`wait()`方法并重新进入同步代码块，因为每一个线程都必须先获得模拟器对象的锁才能够离开`wait()`方法。

##信号丢失（Missed Signals）

The methods notify() and notifyAll() do not save the method calls to them in case no threads are waiting when they are called. The notify signal is then just lost. Therefore, if a thread calls notify() before the thread to signal has called wait(), the signal will be missed by the waiting thread. This may or may not be a problem, but in some cases this may result in the waiting thread waiting forever, never waking up, because the signal to wake up was missed.

该方法的通知（）和notifyAll（）不救的方法调用它们的情况下没有线程在等待的时候，他们被称为。该通知信号然后就失去了。因此，如果一个线程调用notify（）的线程之前，信号调用wait（）时，信号将被等待的线程被错过。这可能会或可能不会成为问题，但在某些情况下，这可能会导致等待线程永远等待，从未苏醒，因为该信号被错过醒来。

To avoid losing signals they should be stored inside the signal class. In the MyWaitNotify example the notify signal should be stored in a member variable inside the MyWaitNotify instance. Here is a modified version of MyWaitNotify that does this:

```Java
public class MyWaitNotify2{

  MonitorObject myMonitorObject = new MonitorObject();
  boolean wasSignalled = false;

  public void doWait(){
    synchronized(myMonitorObject){
      if(!wasSignalled){
        try{
          myMonitorObject.wait();
         } catch(InterruptedException e){...}
      }
      //clear signal and continue running.
      wasSignalled = false;
    }
  }

  public void doNotify(){
    synchronized(myMonitorObject){
      wasSignalled = true;
      myMonitorObject.notify();
    }
  }
}
```

Notice how the doNotify() method now sets the wasSignalled variable to true before calling notify(). Also, notice how the doWait() method now checks the wasSignalled variable before calling wait(). In fact it only calls wait() if no signal was received in between the previous doWait() call and this.

##假唤醒（Spurious Wakeups）

For inexplicable reasons it is possible for threads to wake up even if notify() and notifyAll() has not been called. This is known as spurious wakeups. Wakeups without any reason.

If a spurious wakeup occurs in the MyWaitNofity2 class's doWait() method the waiting thread may continue processing without having received a proper signal to do so! This could cause serious problems in your application.

To guard against spurious wakeups the signal member variable is checked inside a while loop instead of inside an if-statement. Such a while loop is also called a spin lock. The thread awakened spins around until the condition in the spin lock (while loop) becomes false. Here is a modified version of MyWaitNotify2 that shows this:

```Java
public class MyWaitNotify3{

  MonitorObject myMonitorObject = new MonitorObject();
  boolean wasSignalled = false;

  public void doWait(){
    synchronized(myMonitorObject){
      while(!wasSignalled){
        try{
          myMonitorObject.wait();
         } catch(InterruptedException e){...}
      }
      //clear signal and continue running.
      wasSignalled = false;
    }
  }

  public void doNotify(){
    synchronized(myMonitorObject){
      wasSignalled = true;
      myMonitorObject.notify();
    }
  }
}
```

Notice how the wait() call is now nested inside a while loop instead of an if-statement. If the waiting thread wakes up without having received a signal, the wasSignalled member will still be false, and the while loop will execute once more, causing the awakened thread to go back to waiting.

##Multiple Threads Waiting for the Same Signals

The while loop is also a nice solution if you have multiple threads waiting, which are all awakened using notifyAll(), but only one of them should be allowed to continue. Only one thread at a time will be able to obtain the lock on the monitor object, meaning only one thread can exit the wait() call and clear the wasSignalled flag. Once this thread then exits the synchronized block in the doWait() method, the other threads can exit the wait() call and check the wasSignalled member variable inside the while loop. However, this flag was cleared by the first thread waking up, so the rest of the awakened threads go back to waiting, until the next signal arrives.


##Don't call wait() on constant String's or global objects

An earlier version of this text had an edition of the MyWaitNotify example class which used a constant string ( "" ) as monitor object. Here is how that example looked:

```Java
public class MyWaitNotify{

  String myMonitorObject = "";
  boolean wasSignalled = false;

  public void doWait(){
    synchronized(myMonitorObject){
      while(!wasSignalled){
        try{
          myMonitorObject.wait();
         } catch(InterruptedException e){...}
      }
      //clear signal and continue running.
      wasSignalled = false;
    }
  }

  public void doNotify(){
    synchronized(myMonitorObject){
      wasSignalled = true;
      myMonitorObject.notify();
    }
  }
}
```

The problem with calling wait() and notify() on the empty string, or any other constant string is, that the JVM/Compiler internally translates constant strings into the same object. That means, that even if you have two different MyWaitNotify instances, they both reference the same empty string instance. This also means that threads calling doWait() on the first MyWaitNotify instance risk being awakened by doNotify() calls on the second MyWaitNotify instance.

The situation is sketched in the diagram below:

![enter image description here](http://tutorials.jenkov.com/images/java-concurrency/strings-wait-notify.png)

Calling wait()/notify() on string constants
Remember, that even if the 4 threads call wait() and notify() on the same shared string instance, the signals from the doWait() and doNotify() calls are stored individually in the two MyWaitNotify instances. A doNotify() call on the MyWaitNotify 1 may wake threads waiting in MyWaitNotify 2, but the signal will only be stored in MyWaitNotify 1.

At first this may not seem like a big problem. After all, if doNotify() is called on the second MyWaitNotify instance all that can really happen is that Thread A and B are awakened by mistake. This awakened thread (A or B) will check its signal in the while loop, and go back to waiting because doNotify() was not called on the first MyWaitNotify instance, in which they are waiting. This situation is equal to a provoked spurious wakeup. Thread A or B awakens without having been signaled. But the code can handle this, so the threads go back to waiting.

The problem is, that since the doNotify() call only calls notify() and not notifyAll(), only one thread is awakened even if 4 threads are waiting on the same string instance (the empty string). So, if one of the threads A or B is awakened when really the signal was for C or D, the awakened thread (A or B) will check its signal, see that no signal was received, and go back to waiting. Neither C or D wakes up to check the signal they had actually received, so the signal is missed. This situation is equal to the missed signals problem described earlier. C and D were sent a signal but fail to respond to it.

If the doNotify() method had called notifyAll() instead of notify(), all waiting threads had been awakened and checked for signals in turn. Thread A and B would have gone back to waiting, but one of either C or D would have noticed the signal and left the doWait() method call. The other of C and D would go back to waiting, because the thread discovering the signal clears it on the way out of doWait().

You may be tempted then to always call notifyAll() instead notify(), but this is a bad idea performance wise. There is no reason to wake up all threads waiting when only one of them can respond to the signal.

So: Don't use global objects, string constants etc. for wait() / notify() mechanisms. Use an object that is unique to the construct using it. For instance, each MyWaitNotify3 (example from earlier sections) instance has its own MonitorObject instance rather than using the empty string for wait() / notify() calls.
