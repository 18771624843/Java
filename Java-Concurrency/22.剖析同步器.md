虽然很多同步器（锁、信号量、阻塞队列等）在使用方式上不同，但是它们的内部设计上并非总不一样。换言之，**它们内部都是由相同或相似的基本部件组成**。了解这些基本部件对设计同步器非常有帮助，这正是本文将要讲的内容。

（Note: The content of this text is a part result of a M.Sc. student project at the IT University of Copenhagen in the spring 2004 by Jakob Jenkov, Toke Johansen and Lars Bjørn. During this project we asked Doug Lea if he knew of similar work. Interestingly he had come up with similar conclusions independently of this project during the development of the Java 5 concurrency utilities. Doug Lea's work, I believe, is described in the book "Java Concurrency in Practice". This book also contains a chapter with the title "Anatomy of a Synchronizer" with content similar to this text, though not exactly the same.）


绝大部分同步器的目的都是为了在多线程并发环境中保护**临界区（critical section）**。为了实现这些功能，同步器需要包含以下部件：

* 状态（State）
* 访问条件（Access Condition）
* 状态变化（State Changes）
* 通知策略（Notification Strategy）
* Test and Set Method
* Set Method

并不是所有的同步器都包含以上组件，也不是所有的部件都如这里描述的完全一样，然而，你还是可以中找到一个或更多的部件。

##状态（State）

The state of a synchronizer is used by the access condition to determine if a thread can be granted access. In a Lock the state is kept in a boolean saying whether the Lock is locked or not. In a Bounded Semaphore the internal state is kept in a counter (int) and an upper bound (int) which state the current number of "takes" and the maximum number of "takes". In a Blocking Queue the state is kept in the List of elements in the queue and the maximum queue size (int) member (if any).

下面两段代码片段分别来自于**Lock**类和**BoundedSemaphore**类。状态的代码注释标识：

```Java
public class Lock{

  //state is kept here
  private boolean isLocked = false;

  public synchronized void lock() throws InterruptedException{
    while(isLocked){
      wait();
    }
    isLocked = true;
  }

  ...
}
public class BoundedSemaphore {

  //state is kept here
  private int signals = 0;
  private int bound   = 0;
      
  public BoundedSemaphore(int upperBound){
    this.bound = upperBound;
  }

  public synchronized void take() throws InterruptedException{
    while(this.signals == bound) wait();
    this.signal++;
    this.notify();
  }
  ...
}
```

##访问条件（Access Condition）

The access conditions is what determines if a thread calling a test-and-set-state method can be allowed to set the state or not. The access condition is typically based on the state of the synchronizer. The access condition is typically checked in a while loop to guard against Spurious Wakeups. When the access condition is evaluated it is either true or false.

In a Lock the access condition simply checks the value of the isLocked member variable. In a Bounded Semaphore there are actually two access conditions depending on whether you are trying to "take" or "release" the semaphore. If a thread tries to take the semaphore the signals variable is checked against the upper bound. If a thread tries to release the semaphore the signals variable is checked against 0.

Here are two code snippets of a Lock and a BoundedSemaphore with the access condition marked in bold. Notice how the conditions is always checked inside a while loop.

```Java
public class Lock{

  private boolean isLocked = false;

  public synchronized void lock()
  throws InterruptedException{
    //access condition
    while(isLocked){
      wait();
    }
    isLocked = true;
  }

  ...
}
public class BoundedSemaphore {
  private int signals = 0;
  private int bound   = 0;

  public BoundedSemaphore(int upperBound){
    this.bound = upperBound;
  }

  public synchronized void take() throws InterruptedException{
    //access condition
    while(this.signals == bound) wait();
    this.signals++;
    this.notify();
  }

  public synchronized void release() throws InterruptedException{
    //access condition
    while(this.signals == 0) wait();
    this.signals--;
    this.notify();
  }
}
```

##状态变化（State Changes）

Once a thread gains access to the critical section it has to change the state of the synchronizer to (possibly) block other threads from entering it. In other words, the state needs to reflect the fact that a thread is now executing inside the critical section. This should affect the access conditions of other threads attempting to gain access.

In a Lock the state change is the code setting isLocked = true. In a semaphore it is either the code signals-- or signals++;

Here are two code snippets with the state change code marked in bold:

```Java
public class Lock{

  private boolean isLocked = false;

  public synchronized void lock() throws InterruptedException{
    while(isLocked){
      wait();
    }
    //state change
    isLocked = true;
  }

  public synchronized void unlock(){
    //state change
    isLocked = false;
    notify();
  }
}
public class BoundedSemaphore {
  private int signals = 0;
  private int bound   = 0;

  public BoundedSemaphore(int upperBound){
    this.bound = upperBound;
  }

  public synchronized void take() throws InterruptedException{
    while(this.signals == bound) wait();
    //state change
    this.signals++;
    this.notify();
  }

  public synchronized void release() throws InterruptedException{
    while(this.signals == 0) wait();
    //state change
    this.signals--;
    this.notify();
  }
}
```

##通知策略（Notification Strategy）

Once a thread has changed the state of a synchronizer it may sometimes need to notify other waiting threads about the state change. Perhaps this state change might turn the access condition true for other threads.

Notification Strategies typically fall into three categories.

```Java
Notify all waiting threads.
Notify 1 random of N waiting threads.
Notify 1 specific of N waiting thread.
```

Notifying all waiting threads is pretty easy. All waiting threads call wait() on the same object. Once a thread want to notify the waiting threads it calls notifyAll() on the object the waiting threads called wait() on.

Notifying a single random waiting thread is also pretty easy. Just have the notifying thread call notify() on the object the waiting threads have called wait() on. Calling notify makes no guarantee about which of the waiting threads will be notified. Hence the term "random waiting thread".

Sometimes you may need to notify a specific rather than a random waiting thread. For instance if you need to guarantee that waiting threads are notified in a specific order, be it the order they called the synchronizer in, or some prioritized order. To achive this each waiting thread must call wait() on its own, separate object. When the notifying thread wants to notify a specific waiting thread it will call notify() on the object this specific thread has called wait() on. An example of this can be found in the text Starvation and Fairness.

Below is a code snippet with the notification strategy (notify 1 random waiting thread) marked in bold:

```Java
public class Lock{

  private boolean isLocked = false;

  public synchronized void lock() throws InterruptedException{
    while(isLocked){
      //wait strategy - related to notification strategy
      wait();
    }
    isLocked = true;
  }

  public synchronized void unlock(){
    isLocked = false;
    notify(); //notification strategy
  }
}
```

##Test and Set Method

Synchronizer most often have two types of methods of which test-and-set is the first type (set is the other). Test-and-set means that the thread calling this method tests the internal state of the synchronizer against the access condition. If the condition is met the thread sets the internal state of the synchronizer to reflect that the thread has gained access.

The state transition usually results in the access condition turning false for other threads trying to gain access, but may not always do so. For instance, in a Read - Write Lock a thread gaining read access will update the state of the read-write lock to reflect this, but other threads requesting read access will also be granted access as long as no threads has requested write access.

It is imperative that the test-and-set operations are executed atomically meaning no other threads are allowed to execute in the test-and-set method in between the test and the setting of the state.

The program flow of a test-and-set method is usually something along the lines of:

Set state before test if necessary
Test state against access condition
If access condition is not met, wait
If access condition is met, set state, and notify waiting threads if necessary
The lockWrite() method of a ReadWriteLock class shown below is an example of a test-and-set method. Threads calling lockWrite() first sets the state before the test (writeRequests++). Then it tests the internal state against the access condition in the canGrantWriteAccess() method. If the test succeeds the internal state is set again before the method is exited. Notice that this method does not notify waiting threads.

```Java
public class ReadWriteLock{
    private Map<Thread, Integer> readingThreads = new HashMap<Thread, Integer>();

    private int writeAccesses    = 0;
    private int writeRequests    = 0;
    private Thread writingThread = null;

    ...
    
    public synchronized void lockWrite() throws InterruptedException{
        writeRequests++;
        Thread callingThread = Thread.currentThread();
        while(! canGrantWriteAccess(callingThread)){
	        wait();
        }
        writeRequests--;
        writeAccesses++;
        writingThread = callingThread;
    }
    

    ...
}
```

The BoundedSemaphore class shown below has two test-and-set methods: take() and 
release(). Both methods test and sets the internal state.

```Java
public class BoundedSemaphore {
  private int signals = 0;
  private int bound   = 0;

  public BoundedSemaphore(int upperBound){
    this.bound = upperBound;
  }

  
  public synchronized void take() throws InterruptedException{
  while(this.signals == bound) wait();
  this.signals++;
  this.notify();
  }

  public synchronized void release() throws InterruptedException{
  while(this.signals == 0) wait();
  this.signals--;
  this.notify();
  }
  
}
```

##Set Method

The set method is the second type of method that synchronizers often contain. The set method just sets the internal state of the synchronizer without testing it first. A typical example of a set method is the unlock() method of a Lock class. A thread holding the lock can always unlock it without having to test if the Lock is unlocked.

The program flow of a set method is usually along the lines of:

Set internal state
Notify waiting threads
Here is an example unlock() method:

```Java
public class Lock{

  private boolean isLocked = false;
  
  public synchronized void unlock(){
	  isLocked = false;
      notify();
  }
  
}
```
