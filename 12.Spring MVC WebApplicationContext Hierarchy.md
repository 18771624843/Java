#12.Spring MVC WebApplicationContext Hierarchy

在Spring MVC中，__DispatcherServlet__用于接收请求并将请求分配到相应的__控制器（Controller）__进行处理，我们可以称DispatcherServlet为__前端控制器__。

In Spring MVC, the DispatcherServletis the central servlet that receives requests and dispatches them 
to the appropriate controllers. In a Spring MVC application, there can be any number of 
DispatcherServlets for various purposes (for example, handling user interface requests, RESTful-WS 
requests, and so on), and each DispatcherServlethas its own WebApplicationContextconfiguration, 
which defines the servlet-level characteristics, suchas controllers supporting the servlet, handler 
mapping, view resolving, i18n, theming, validation, type conversion and formatting, and so on. 
Underneath the servlet-level WebApplicationContextconfigurations, Spring MVC also maintains a 
root WebApplicationContext, which includes the application-level configurations such as backend data 
source, security, service and persistence layer configuration, and so on. The root WebApplicationContext
will be available to all servlet-level WebApplicationContext. 
Let’s look at an example. Let’s say in an application we have two DispatcherServlets. One servlet is 
to support the user interface (we call itthe application servlet), and the other is to provide services in the 
form of RESTful-WS to other applications (we call it the RESTful servlet). In Spring MVC, we will define 
the configurations for both the root WebApplicationContextand the WebApplicationContextfor the two 
DispatcherServlets. Figure 17-2 shows the WebApplicationContexthierarchy that will be maintained by 
Spring MVC for this scenario.
