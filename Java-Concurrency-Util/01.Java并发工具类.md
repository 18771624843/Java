#01.Java并发工具类

Java 5 added a new Java package to the Java platform, the java.util.concurrent package. This package contains a set of classes that makes it easier to develop concurrent (multithreaded) applications in Java. Before this package was added, you would have to program your utility classes yourself.

In this tutorial I will take you through the new java.util.concurrent classes, one by one, so you can learn how to use them. I will use the versions in Java 6. I am not sure if there are any differences to the Java 5 versions.

I will not explain the core issues of concurrency in Java - the theory behind it, that is. If you are interested in that, check out my Java Concurrency tutorial.


##Work in Progress

This tutorial is very much "work in progress", so if you spot a missing class or interface, please be patient. I will add it when I get the time to do it.


##Table of Contents

Here is a list of the topics covered in this java.util.concurrent trail. This list (menu) is also present at the top right of every page in the trail.


##Feel Free to Contact Me

If you disagree with anything I write here about the java.util.concurrent utilities, or just have comments, questions, etc, feel free to send me an email. You wouldn't be the first to do so. You can find my email address on the about page.
