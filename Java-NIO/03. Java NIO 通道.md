#03. Java NIO 通道

Java NIO的通道（Channels）类似与标准IO中的**流（Stream）**，它们之间的区别在于：

* 你可以从管道中读取或写入数据（双向），但是流只能是读取或写入（单向）。
* 通道可以进行异步（Asynchonously）操作。
* 通道（Channel）总是从缓冲区（Buffers）中读取或写入数据。

如上面所提到的，数据总是从管道中读取到缓冲区，后从缓冲区中写入到通道。如下图所示：

Java NIO Channels are similar to streams with a few differences:

You can both read and write to a Channels. Streams are typically one-way (read or write).
Channels can be read and written asynchronously.
Channels always read to, or write from, a Buffer.
As mentioned above, you read data from a channel into a buffer, and write data from a buffer into a channel. Here is an illustration of that:

Channel Implementations

Here are the most important Channel implementations in Java NIO:

FileChannel
DatagramChannel
SocketChannel
ServerSocketChannel
The FileChannel reads data from and to files.

The DatagramChannel can read and write data over the network via UDP.

The SocketChannel can read and write data over the network via TCP.

The ServerSocketChannel allows you to listen for incoming TCP connections, like a web server does. For each incoming connection a SocketChannel is created.

Basic Channel Example

Here is a basic example that uses a FileChannel to read some data into a Buffer:

```Java
RandomAccessFile aFile = new RandomAccessFile("data/nio-data.txt", "rw");
FileChannel inChannel = aFile.getChannel();

ByteBuffer buf = ByteBuffer.allocate(48);

int bytesRead = inChannel.read(buf);
while (bytesRead != -1) {

	System.out.println("Read " + bytesRead);
	buf.flip();

	while(buf.hasRemaining()){
	    System.out.print((char) buf.get());
	}

	buf.clear();
	bytesRead = inChannel.read(buf);
}
aFile.close();
```
   
Notice the buf.flip() call. First you read into a Buffer. Then you flip it. Then you read out of it. I'll get into more detail about that in the next text about Buffer's.
